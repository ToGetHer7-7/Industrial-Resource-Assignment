This method offers flexibility in modelling custom constraints and variables, making it highly adaptable to a wide range of problems. The solver used in PuLP depends on the default solver, such as CBC, but can be modified depending on the user’s preference.  \n",

The network simplex algorithm in networkx inherently works with integer flows when capacities and supplies/demands are integers, ensuring a natural alignment with the problem's requirements. This allows for direct interpretation of the solution in terms of assignments without needing additional rounding or post-processing steps.  \n",

This property ensures that even when the problem is relaxed, the solution remains integer, guaranteeing that both the PuLP and networkx approaches deliver exact, optimal solutions."
